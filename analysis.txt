Some of the relationships we can see in skipgram_model.png, are the existence of some french words all grouped, probably because some of 
the texts were in french and those words only shared those texts as input. These words can be found in the top left corner. Also on the 
left, around 0 we can see several terms related with politics, physolophy and religion, which are topics that are usually related, noticing
specially a lot of movements ending in ism, which basically share the same spot on the grid. Down in the middle there are words related 
with the past like ancient or indigenous. These are some of the many relationships found in this picture, which clearly shows how it has 
been trained properly.
